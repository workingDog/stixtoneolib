## A Scala library to load STIX-2 objects to a Neo4j graph database

This library **stixtoneolib** provides for loading [STIX-2](https://oasis-open.github.io/cti-documentation/) 
objects and relations into a [Neo4j](https://neo4j.com/) graph database. 

The [OASIS](https://www.oasis-open.org/) open standard Structured Threat Information Expression [STIX-2](https://oasis-open.github.io/cti-documentation/) 
is a language for expressing cyber threat and observable information.

[Neo4j](https://neo4j.com/) "is a highly scalable native graph database that leverages data 
relationships as first-class entities, helping enterprises build intelligent applications 
to meet todayâ€™s evolving data challenges."
In essence, a graph database and processing engine that is used here for storing Stix objects 
and their relationships.
 
**stixtoneolib** provides a set of classes and methods to convert [STIX-2](https://oasis-open.github.io/cti-documentation/) 
domain objects (SDO) and relationships (SRO) to [Neo4j](https://neo4j.com/) nodes and relations 
using the [Java Neo4j API](https://neo4j.com/docs/java-reference/current/javadocs/). 
The library adds the converted STIX-2 objects and bundles to an existing Neo4j graph database 
or creates a new one. The library includes methods for processing text files containing 
STIX-2 bundles in JSON format and zip files.
    
### Installation and packaging

**stixtoneolib** is a library for use in Scala (2.13.3) applications to convert and load STIX-2 objects 
into a Neo4j graph database. To use the latest release add the following dependency to your *build.sbt*:

    libraryDependencies += "com.github.workingDog" %% "stixtoneolib" % "0.6"


The current source code version is **0.7-SNAPSHOT** using scala 2.13.3. 

To compile and package **stixtoneolib** from source use [SBT](http://www.scala-sbt.org/).
To compile and generate a jar file from source:

    sbt package

This will produce *stixtoneolib-0.7-SNAPSHOT.jar* in the *./target/scala-2.13* directory. 
See the *build.sbt* file for the required dependencies.
      
To publish the library to your local (Ivy) repository, simply type:

    sbt publishLocal

Then put this in your Scala application *build.sbt* file:

    libraryDependencies += "com.github.workingDog" %% "stixtoneolib" % "0.7-SNAPSHOT" 
       
### Usage

The main class for loading STIX-2 objects into a Neo4j database is **Neo4jLoader**.
This class constructor requires a Neo4j database directory name, which is used to connect to an 
existing database or create a new database. In addition a **Logger** can be passed-in implicitly 
to log the loading progress, defaults to no Logger if absent. 
**Neo4jLoader** has two main methods: 

    loadIntoNeo4j(bundle)  to load a bundle of STIX-2 objects into a Neo4j database
    loadIntoNeo4j(stix)    to load a STIX-2 object into a Neo4j database

**Neo4jLoader** delegates the creation of Neo4j nodes and relations 
to **NodesMaker** and **RelationsMaker** classes respectively. Typically, nodes are 
created first followed by the relations.

In addition the **Neo4jFileLoader** helper class has four methods for processing files of STIX-2 bundles:

    loadBundleFile(infile)        to load a file containing a bundle of STIX-2 objects
    loadBundleZipFile(infile)     to load a zip file containing files each having a bundle of STIX-2 objects
    
    loadLargeTextFile(infile)     to load one line at a time a file containing a STIX-2 object on one line
    loadLargeZipTextFile(infile)  to load one line at a time a zip file containing files each having a STIX-2 object on one line

An example use of **stixtoneolib** is [StixToNeoDB](https://github.com/workingDog/StixToNeoDB) 
which loads files of STIX-2 data into a Neo4j database.

### Dependencies and requirements

Depends on the [ScalaStix](https://github.com/workingDog/scalastix) and 
the [Neo4j Community 3.5.5](https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/org.neo4j/neo4j) jar file.

See also the *build.sbt* file.

Neo4j Community Edition should be installed to process the results.
